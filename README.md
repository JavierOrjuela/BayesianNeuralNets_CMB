Please consider citing the paper when any of the material is used for your research.

Data_generator provide a dataset for either CMB Temperature(+Polarization)  or 21cm maps. Additionally, the DropourBNN_example.py shows an example of BNN using Dropout. For a more general treatment of BNN, download the Argo library https://github.com/rist-ro/argo 

Chains.zip and PS_POL...npy, PS_TT...npy are the chains generated from Cobaya and BNNs(Argo Lib.) respectively reported in the Sec.II of the paper "Parameters Estimation for the Cosmic Microwave Background with Bayesian Neural Networks".
